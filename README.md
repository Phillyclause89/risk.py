# risk.py
My attempt at coding the logic needed to play the board game risk. The game is played using text commands inputed into the console. Right now the bots are random, but I hope to use this a playground to make some rl bots that can play risk^1.

^1 Rules have been slightly modified in regards to how the cards work. (Play Ubisoft's Risks Factions.)
